## Implementation Details 

- How did you decompose the big problem into small manageable pieces? 
- What is the role of each sprite class? 
- How / when do the sprites interact or communicate with each other? 
- Explain the role of any important variables.

Include a decomposition diagram and the main role of each decomposed part.

For the decomposition diagram, include each implemented class with their properties and methods and draw arrows between classes that interact with eachother. Draw by hand first. You can take a picture and add it to your page. If you want to draw the diagram digitally, you can use [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) or any other software of your choice. Here is a [template](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1L7rig3DPeSpGgIQCM0IddXcho81k86jn) which you can use.
